    "and pre-paid for tickets so with this money returning to your accounts, we hope you consider donating a portion "
    "of your refund to really make a difference. Our survey presented that 70% of students would donate a portion of their "
    "refund so we hope as many people as possible consider donating!";

    "vital support for patients and staff in the ICU that goes above and beyond what the NHS would provide.";

const String Q7 =
    "How were the charities selected?";

const String A7 =
    "We conducted a survey taken by 200 students on what type of charities they wanted to donate to. The majority wanted "
    "local, Covid-related and co-benefit charities which is why, with the help of Effective Altruism's report, we selected "
    "Addenbrooke's charitable trust and CESR.";
